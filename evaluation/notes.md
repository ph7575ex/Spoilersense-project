# Evaluation Notes
- The current dataset is intentionally small and meant for early iteration.
- Next step: expand with real-world examples from target sites (Reddit, YouTube, Google snippets).
- Track common false positive patterns (e.g., reviews using the word “ending” without revealing plot details).
